"""Summarise what a fresh parser run would change in the committed catalog.

`tools/build.py` rewrites data/boards/*.json in place while preserving the
human-owned `manual` block and the AI-gathered `ai` block. So after running it
against a current ArduPilot checkout, any remaining git diff under data/boards
is *build-derived drift*: either upstream hwdef changed, or our parser did.

That distinction matters. A parser tweak that silently alters 90 boards looks
exactly like a quiet commit until someone notices a spec is wrong — which, for
a catalogue people buy hardware from, is the failure that actually costs
something.

Usage (expects `git` to see the modified working tree):

    python tools/drift_report.py                 # markdown to stdout
    python tools/drift_report.py --fail-on-drift # exit 1 when anything changed

Exit codes: 0 = no drift, 1 = drift found (only with --fail-on-drift), 2 = error.
