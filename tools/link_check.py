"""Check every outbound link in the catalog and report the dead ones.

Vendor links rot faster than anything else here. Over one working session:
mrobotics.io stopped resolving and now redirects to store.3dr.com, several
Matek product pages returned 404, three of the H743 family's pages are marked
EOL, and Flywoo sits behind a challenge that refuses automated requests
entirely. A dead link on a spec page is worse than no link — it sends someone
choosing hardware nowhere.

Checked in one pass rather than per-source because the failure is the same
whichever field it lives in:

    board.docs_url               ArduPilot wiki page
    board.repo_url               hwdef README / directory on GitHub
    manual.ardupilot_repo_url    vendor or repo link
    manual.documents[].url       vendor datasheets and manuals
    manufacturers[].website      vendor home page
    manufacturers[].store_url    direct store
    manufacturers[].distributors_url  reseller list

Some hosts refuse HEAD, so a failed HEAD is retried as a ranged GET before
being called dead. Sites that block automation outright (403/429 from a WAF)
are reported separately from genuine 404s — the first needs a human to look,
the second needs the link fixing.
