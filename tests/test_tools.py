"""Tests for the maintenance tooling itself.

link_check.py and drift_report.py are the scripts that decide whether anyone
gets told about a broken link or a silently changed catalog. A bug in either is
invisible by construction — the failure mode is a report that says nothing is
wrong. Both had a false-positive problem during development (an unhelpful
"URLError" for two different real causes; GitHub rate limits read as 404s), so
their pure logic is worth pinning.

Nothing here touches the network: only the URL collection, the error
classification and the diff shaping are exercised.
